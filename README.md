# Frontend Development with React Certification Projects

![Frontend Development banner](./banner.png)

Welcome! This repository hosts the projects that are part of my journey to obtain the Frontend Development with React Certification from FreeCodeCamp. Each project has been designed and built to showcase my skills in frontend development using React as the primary library.

Through these projects, I have gained experience in React usage, DOM manipulation, state management, routing, and developing modern and user-friendly user interfaces.
